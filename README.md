# Pastel Cutie Syntax Theme

Just a cute pastel Atom syntax theme for guys, gals, and nonbinary pals. Configured mainly with front-end/web development in mind (JavaScript, HTML, CSS), but should work with other languages as well! Font pictured is Cartograph CF, but only because I was able to con my boss into buying me a license. Please forgive this nonsense sample code; trying to get barba.js to play nicely with Wordpress is an ongoing struggle.
